# frontier
The primary purpose of this repo is to hold frontier projects which includes the Brain project.
It also serves as the mian repo of choice for other projects with the potential to change humanity and the way we think and use machines.

Contributors are encouraged think about projects, codes and/or software that can be used to benefit humanity as a whole. 
As with the Brain project, projects should try to address two simple questions.
1) Is it going to improve the humanity? If Yes - You're welcome to contribute
2) Does it adversely affect, in anyway, others who might otherwise not benifit from it? If the answer to this is YES. STOP. Do not attempt to use this repository for the project

Together, I hope we can create amazing projects that all of us can enjoy.
